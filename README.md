# Hotel-Ordering-Application

## Abstract:
The food sector is extremely labour-intensive, and the cost of hiring the right people
to accomplish the job is the most significant expense. One option to cut costs is to
employ contemporary technology to automate some of the jobs that would otherwise
be done by humans. We suggest an "Online Food Ordering System" in this project. An
online food ordering system can be defined as software that allows restaurant
businesses to accept and manage orders placed over the internet. The technique can be
utilised in any industry that delivers meals. Because the entire process of processing
orders is automated, this simplifies the food ordering procedure for both the client and
the restaurant. The goal of this project is to create a Web-based ordering food
application that includes New Order, Order History, Restaurant Profile, Order Status,
Order Tracking, and Reviews/Feedbacks. This technique will enable hotels and
restaurants to expand their company by lowering personnel costs. Customers pay with
their credit cards, albeit they can be served even before making a cash or credit card
payment. Our online ordering systems generally consist of 2 main components. First is
a website for hungry customers to view the restaurant's dishes and place an online
order. Second is an admin management interface for the restaurants to receive and
manage the customer's orders.
